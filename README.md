Orginally published by McGraw Hill in 2009, Design for Electrical and Computer Engineers is written for 
students and teachers engaged in electrical and computer engineering design projects, 
primarily in the senior year. It guides students and faculty through the steps necessary for the successful 
execution of design projects. The objective is to provide a treatment of the design process with a sound academic 
basis that is integrated with practical application. The foundation of the book is a strong vision — that a solid 
understanding of the Design Process, Design Tools, and the right mix of Professional Skills are critical for project 
and career success. This text is unique in providing a comprehensive design treatment for electrical and computer 
engineering.
