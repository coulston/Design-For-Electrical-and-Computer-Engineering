\item
  Consider the nine dot puzzle shown in Figure~\ref{figure:dotsProblems} (b). Draw
  \textbf{three} connected straight lines that pass through all nine
  dots.

\item
  Consider the six sticks shown below. Rearrange the sticks to produce
  four equilat­eral triangles (the sticks cannot be broken).
\item
  Consider the fish shown below made of eight sticks and a coin for the
  eye. The objective is to make the fish face the other direction by
  moving only the coin and three sticks.

\item
  For each of the following lateral thinking puzzles, develop a
  plausible solution (from Paul Sloane's \ul{Lateral Thinking Puzzles}
  {[}http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/sloane{]}):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A man walks into a bar and asks the barman for a glass of water. The
  barman pulls out a gun and points it at the man. The man says
  \textquotesingle Thank you\textquotesingle{} and walks out.
\item
  A woman had two sons who were born on the same hour of the same day of
  the same year. But they were not twins. How could this be so?
\item
  Why is it better to have round manhole covers than square ones?
\item
  A man went to a party and drank some of the punch. He then left early.
  Everyone else at the party who drank the punch subsequently died of
  poisoning. Why did the man not die?
\end{itemize}

\item
  Legislation was passed to allow handguns in the cockpits of passenger
  airliners to prevent hijacking. Brainstorm to develop concepts that
  prevent anyone other than the pilot from using the handgun.
\item
  Imagine if scientists and engineers were able to develop a technology
  that would allow people to be transported from any place on earth to
  another instantaneously. Brainstorm to determine the potential impact
  this would have on society.
\item
  Student advising at many colleges and universities is seen as an area
  that can be im­proved. Brainstorm to develop ideas as to how student
  advising could be improved at your college or university.
\item
  In your own words, describe what a concept table and a concept fan
  are.
\item
  Consider the problem solved in 
  Section~\ref{subsection:analytical-hierarchy-process-and-decision-matrices}. 
  For this example assume   that:
\begin{itemize}

\item
  The following is the result of the paired comparison.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
              &
Accuracy &
Cost &
Size &
Availability \\ \hline
Accuracy & 1 & 1/3 & 2 & ½ \\ \hline
Cost & 3 & 1 & 5 & 1 \\ \hline
Size & 1/2 & 1/5 & 1 & 2 \\ \hline
Availability & 2 & 1 & ½ & 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\item
  The parts costs are the following: resistors = \$0.05, bipolar
  transistors (BJTs) = \$0.10, op amps = \$0.35, and RTDs = \$0.25.
\item
  The parts have an in-stock availability of 99\%, 90\%, 85\%, and 70\%
  of the time for the re­sistors, BJTs, RTDs, and op amps respectively.
\item
  Everything else is the same as presented in 
  Section~\ref{subsection:analytical-hierarchy-process-and-decision-matrices}.
\end{itemize}

Compute the rankings of the design options using a weighted decision
matrix of the type shown in Table~\ref{table:pairwiseCompMatrix}.


\item
  \textbf{Project Application.} Utilize the methods in this chapter to
  generate con­cepts for your particular design problem. Critically
  evaluate the concepts generated using one or more of the techniques
  presented in the chapter that is appropriate for the problem. 
  Section~\ref{section:project-application-concept-generation-and-evaluation}
  pro­vides guidance on how to conduct this process and document the
  results.
