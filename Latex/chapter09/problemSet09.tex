\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Explain the difference between cross-functional and multi-disciplinary
  teams.
\item
  Identify the characteristics of the forming, storming, norming and
  performing stages in team development.
\item
  Describe the distinction between teams and teamwork.
\item
  According to this chapter, it is difficult to develop a consensus as
  the number of team members increases. Consider the situation where a
  team needs to agree on a proposal. Furthermore, assume that each team
  member's vote is random with a 50\% chance of agreeing with the
  proposal. Plot the probability of the team unanimously agreeing to the
  proposal versus the number of team members. Consider team sizes from 2
  to 10. Overlay three additional plots for the situation where each
  team member has a 75\%, 90\%, and 99\% chance of agreeing to the
  proposal.
\item
  \textbf{Project Application.} Develop Team Process Guidelines as
  proposed in Section 9.4.
\item
  \textbf{Project Application}. Complete the team self-assessment in
  Table 9.1.
