\textbf{Preface: How to Use This Manual}\\

This manual provides solutions to the problems found in 
\ul{Design for Electrical and Computer Engineers: Theory, Concepts, and Practice}. 
For guidance to instructor’s we identify problems as
either: review, application, and project. Review-type problems usually ask the student to restate
an important concept from the text, whereas application problems are those where the students
are required to solve a more in-depth project that demonstrates an understanding of the concepts
learned to a new scenario. Project problems are important steps in the completion of a senior
capstone design project. Each particular problem is categorized in this solutions manual as to the
type of problem it is by using the key [R], [A], and [P].\\

Furthermore, we also provide our guidance (identified in the manual as Notes), from experience
teaching the material, with pointers on how we present the material and apply it to student
projects. Selected project assignments are also supplied.\\


\textit{We also ask that instructor’s keep this manual for instructor use only and do not post or
otherwise distribute our solutions in any form. Unfortunately, it is becoming all too common
for solutions to be copied and distributed over the Internet, thus hurting other instructors
using the book.}

\textbf{Feedback}\\
Feedback and suggestions concerning any aspect of this manual, that would likely benefit the
overall presentation, would be much appreciated. Please send your comments via email to
Ralph-Ford@psu.edu or coulston@mines.edu
